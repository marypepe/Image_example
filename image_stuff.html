      Harry Styles is a beautiful man. His name sounds like hairstyles. He has nice hair. He once was in a band called No Directions. Just kidding... he was in One Direction. He is British. Which means he is probably on the left spectrum of the political spectrum. Most of Britain is fairly socialist. </p>
